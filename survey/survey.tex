\section*{Introduction}

\quad Social media is everywhere. 
Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit make it easy for people to communicate with each other and stay informed about global events.
However, its omnipresence also provides a platform that commercial entities can easily exploit for their own interests.
For example, a company could use a social media bot to promote its own products and write glowing reviews on websites such as Yelp and Google Reviews while posting negative reviews on its competitors' products.
This is a lose-lose situation for both businesses and consumers; businesses must constantly defend themselves from the onslaught of negative feedback while consumers will lose trust in information from social media.
Therefore, in this survey, we will discuss methods that can be used to differentiate between real users and non-human users.

\quad At the general level, this is an anomaly detection problem.
Historically, there have been many approaches to anomaly detection, such as Poisson, SFC, Pearson's $\chi^2$, and CNPP.
We will analyze the pros and cons of these existing methods.
Next, we will introduce state-of-the-art models that attempt to address some of the shortcomings of these more mature models and highlight their relative improvements.
